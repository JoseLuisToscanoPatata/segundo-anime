# Introduction

<p style="text-align:justify;">Here you can check info about the rest API created for our web app, like descriptions, parámeters or even posibles responses.  <p style="text-align:justify;">PD: In end Points which return arrays as data said array is not shown (for space purposes) and is replace with the simbol "[]", in any case, that array will contain objects of the data returned in the shown end point of thar table </p>

<aside>As you scroll, you'll see code examples for working with the API in different programming languages in the dark area to the right (or as part of the content on mobile).
You can switch the language used with the tabs at the top right (or from the nav menu at the top left on mobile).</aside>
